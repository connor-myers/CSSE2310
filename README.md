CSSE2310 is a introductory systems programming course at the University of Queensland. The course is taught in C.

### Assignment One

Assignment One was a general C programming assignment.

The task was to create a game called *push2310*, similar to tic-tac-toe but with the added ability to move other player's placements.

### Assignment Two

This was a debugging assignment held on the university's remote server, which is why it is missing in this repo.

### Assignment Three

Assignment Three was yet another terminal based game, but the learning aspects for this game was processes (specifically, forking) and inter-process communication using pipes.

### Assignment Four

Assignment Four was a networking assignment which (very simplistically) modelled an airport system.
